# Task List
CRUD app for a Task List created with Vite, Javascript and CSS. You can add as many tasks as you want, mark them as finished, edit them or delete them. The app uses LocalStorage to make sure the tasks don't disappear upon refresh. Both Dark and Light Mode can be toggled by the user, but it picks up the user's personal preference by default.
